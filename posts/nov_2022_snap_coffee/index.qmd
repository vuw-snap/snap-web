<h1>SNAP's bimonthley coffee</h1>

On 4th Nov we had our 2nd coffee meeting, this is the first in person SNAP meeting since COVID restrictions were relaxed. We had a wonderful crowd arrive with 20 plus people from across the university. Do come to our next coffee meeting and chat science, humanities, health, linguistics and much more ...
