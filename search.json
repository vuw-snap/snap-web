    "text": "“Even learning very basic programming, even if you’re not very good at it, I think it totally transforms the idea of what you’re doing with that computer, or what a computer should be able to do for you.”\n\nFor the past year or so, Dr Michael Radich, Senior Lecturer in VUW’s Religious Studies Programme, has set aside an hour a day to learn Python, a widely-used, high-level computer language. It’s not common for someone in his field (he specialises in the study of Buddhist texts) to delve this far into the world of programming, but it’s the kind of disciplined dedication that’s enabled him to gain a degree in music composition, a PhD from Harvard, and teach himself no less than ten natural languages.\nDuring an hour-and-a-half long discussion over coffee at Milk and Honey, I learn that getting to grips with his first programming language has been one of the most frustrating endeavours of his career, but also one of the most rewarding.\n“I was worried the learning curve would be too long and steep. Now I’ve reached that good point where I figure the process is so intrinsically worthwhile that the calculus of input to endpoint has become immaterial.”\nIn other words, the payoff has proved to be well worth the time invested, even though “it drives me up the wall quite regularly, and I spit the dummy fairly regularly too.”\nThe reason I’ve pinned him down for an interview is that Michael belongs to a new generation of humanities researchers embracing computational methods and quantitative analysis to challenge assumptions, find new ways to answer time-honoured questions, and to ask new ones.\nHis story, like many in this space of digital research, begins with a particular problem; in his case it’s how to accurately determine authorship of select parts of the 3000 canonical Chinese Buddhist texts. To get a sense of the scale Michael’s dealing with, the Chinese Buddhist canon is 243 times larger than all the biblical texts combined. Imagine a set of those Encyclopaedia Britannicas you see forlornly collecting dust at your local Sally Army store — you’d need over four of those to match the canon’s 188 million words.\nDuring a kind of cultural ‘arms race’ in the 90s, however, Japan, Korea and Taiwan all competed to be the first to digitise the full Buddhist canon. Researchers in the field now have access to not one but three digitised versions of the entire corpus. Seeing an opportunity to dig deeper, Michael teamed up with local developer Jamie Norrish to create an open-source tool called TACL (Textual Analysis for Corpus Linguistics), which helps sift through millions of Chinese character strings and returns an avalanche of raw data to explore further.\nIf the Chinese Buddhist canon is the proverbial haystack, think of TACL as a well-calibrated metal detector capable of pointing the way to more needles than anyone realised even existed. But as Michael contends, to fruitfully sort the desired needles from misleading shrapnel takes the disciplinary knowledge of a human expert. TACL allows for increased exploratory power, but Michael’s extensive and hard-earned expertise provides the explanatory power needed to frame this wealth of evidence in a way which maximises impact and minimises misunderstanding.\nIt’s a great example of the kind of rich analysis and argument made possible when the minds of machine and man work in tandem. As Michael points out, “Computers are just weird collaborators.”\nOver the course of our conversation I’m reminded that even when a topic is esoteric and arcane, a researcher’s passion can be infectious, bridging the gap between the minute details of a disciplinary rabbit hole and the general interest of a layperson such as myself. Seemingly curious and critical in equal measures, I love how Michael’s calm, considered manner gives way to a boyish enthusiasm when discussing the subjects that excite him: not only Buddhist texts, but also language learning and educational philosophy.\nOn the benefits of learning a second language, for example, he opines: “If you don’t know a second language, just learn one. Not having a second language is practically like missing a limb . . . one of the most important lessons [from learning another language] is that things can be done differently — even apparently simple or obvious things can be said differently, or thought differently.”\nKeeping an open mind, embracing the uncertainty that comes with true learning, and always remaining up for a new challenge — these are the qualities that characterise the best academic minds, minds like Michael’s that never seem to settle for the status quo. And increasingly, even in the humanities, these minds are turning to computational methods as another way of realising things can be thought — and done — differently.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "The HPC Morning Tea is the best way to ask your questions about the Rāpoi cluster or simply chat to the support staff from CAD’s Research Capability Team. A hot beverage, a snack and updates on high performance computing – what’s not to like?\n\nHPC morning tea meetings happen several times a year with the intention to run at least once a trimester. In addition to socialising with other Rāpoi users (from those who are just starting to weathered HPC veterans), these meetings are an important way to stay have your input and learn from the team what are the steps to getting important jobs scheduled and prioritised, and how to negotiate more efficient student access if you intend to use Rāpoi for teaching.\n2022 Rāpoi Usage The April meeting started with a presentation of the 2022 Rāpoi Utilisation Report, featuring data on usage statistics for 2022, also providing a perspective on longer-term trends from 2019 till last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of submitted jobs has increased massively in 2022 compared to previous years with over 65% of the job submissions occurring between October and December: something you might want to keep in mind when planning when to use Rāpoi for your own research! The biggest users in 2022 are ECS (more than 56% of the actual CPU hours used), SCPS (31%), followed by SBS (5%) with the rest of the schools and CPUs only using a small percentage of the actual CPU hours used. If these jobs had been done through external providers like NeSI or AWS, the cost to VUW would have been between 1.84 and 2.56 million NZD.\n\nResults from the User Survey About 15% of the currently active Rāpoi users filled out the annual survey. The majority of them were PhD students or Postdocs, followed by Academic staff, with only a small portion of Research fellows and professional staff. Onboarding has been a predominantly positive experience for everyone although the team takes into account the difficulties associated with delays in approving staff accounts and the barrier to access through VPN was a topic of discussion during the morning tea. Slack remains the preferred communication channel, but changes to its subscription model and cost create the need to come up with an alternative. HackMD and transferring Q&A and support advice from Slack to Wiki were discussed. A short training on how to organise and properly document support advice on the Wiki will be provided this year and the support team is open to suggestions for tools that can serve as a repository for the data that will no longer be held long-term by Slack. Currently the research output created with the help of Rāpoi is tracked through the survey and the Slack channel so the team strongly encourages this information to be added to your publications and Elements profiles. Based on Slack and survey submissions, in 2022 Rāpoi was used for projects which resulted in over 20 journal articles and conference papers, published in journals with an average impact factor of 8.79. Output created and submitted for publication in 2022 but published in early 2023 included at least 6 papers in journals with average impact factor of 4.05.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
